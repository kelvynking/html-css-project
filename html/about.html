                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I am currently undertaking a part-time Software Engineering course through Academy Xi.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, I am the Director of <a href="https://hampertree.com.au/" target="_blank">Hamper Tree</a>. This is an online retail business which I established in July 2020 and continue to run to this day.</p>
                    <p>It was also my privilege to have been appointed the Director of Household Affairs in July 2019 upon the birth of my beautiful daughter.</p>
                    <p>Prior to the above, I had worked as a Commercial Property Manager and Sales Consultant for a good number of years.</p>
                    <p>It is my ultimate goal to work within the software engineering industry and an aspiration to be an outstanding software developer in due course.</p> 
                    <p>Some of my interests include travelling, cooking, performing arts and dance.</p>airs. In short, a high performing specialist in organization, prioritization and execution. I am ready to step into the world of software development and make a difference. One piece of code at a time.</p>
