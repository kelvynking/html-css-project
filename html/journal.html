                    <p>This is where you will find my musings on the journey to being a Software Engineer. As someone who had the impression that coding and computers were just out of this world and beyond my comprehension, I never gave a second thought to how programs work and just accepted that they are there for our convenience. However, a decision to challenge and better myself made me decide to begin this journey. It was such a cathartic experience the moment I saw my very first piece of code do it's magic on the screen. Granted it was only basic HTML but the power and potential are only beginning to be untapped. Follow my journey through this <a href="https://kelvynking.medium.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.
